# Introduction

This task will help you understand how to merge branches and resolve conflicts in Git. Additionally, you will create a **.txt** file to track the commands you run during the process.


## Merge Two Branches

- fork this repository
- clone it to your local machine
- make a `develop` branch from `main`
- add `.gitignore` file to develop
- create new branch `f1` from `develop`
- create `index.txt` file in `f1` branch with some content
- push `f1` branch to remote
- create a new branch `f2` from `develop`
- create `index.txt` file in `f2` branch with some other content in it
- push `f2` branch to remote
- merge `f1` branch to `develop` in your local machine
- merge `f2` branch to `develop` in your local machine
  - (it could be conflicts) resolve them and combine content in `index.txt`
- push `develop` to remote
- make merge request (MR) from `develop` to `main`
- submit a link of MR to assignment
